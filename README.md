# relative-allele-age
Code for relative allele age work and transfer report 

Each directory contains scripts to generate the simulation data shown in my transfer report. 
-analytical_ordering generates data for figure 3.4.
-freq_compare_transfer generates data for figure 3.6.
-geva_comparison and out_of_africa_fig_transfer generate data for figure 3.7.
-directly_comparable generates data for figure 3.8.

The jupyter notebook contains code to create plots from these data.
